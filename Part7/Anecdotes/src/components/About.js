    <em>
      An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an
      incident. Occasionally humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their
      primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter but to reveal a truth
      more general than the brief tale itself.

      Software engineering is full of excellent anecdotes
